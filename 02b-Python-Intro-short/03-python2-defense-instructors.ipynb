This is called [defensive programming](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/reference.html#defensive-programming), and the most common way to do it is to add [assertions](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/reference.html#assertion) to our code so that it checks itself as it runs. An assertion is simply a statement that something must be true at a certain point in a program. When Python sees one, it evaluates the assertion’s condition. If it’s true, Python does nothing, but if it’s false, Python halts the program immediately and prints the error message if one is provided. For example, this piece of code halts as soon as the loop encounters a value that isn’t positive:"
