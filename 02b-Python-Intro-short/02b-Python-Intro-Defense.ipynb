This is called [defensive programming](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/reference.html#defensive-programming), and the most common way to do it is to add [assertions](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/reference.html#assertion) to our code so that it checks itself as it runs. An assertion is simply a statement that something must be true at a certain point in a program. When Python sees one, it evaluates the assertion\u2019s condition. If it\u2019s true, Python does nothing, but if it\u2019s false, Python halts the program immediately and prints the error message if one is provided.

    "The first step in debugging something is to _know what it\u2019s supposed to do_. \u201cMy program doesn\u2019t work\u201d isn\u2019t good enough: in order to diagnose and fix problems, we need to be able to tell correct output from incorrect. If we can write a test case for the failing case \u2014 i.e., if we can assert that with _these_ inputs, the function should produce _that_ result \u2014 then we\u2019re ready to start debugging. If we can\u2019t, then we need to figure out how we\u2019re going to know when we\u2019ve fixed things.\n",
    "\n",
    "But writing test cases for scientific software is frequently harder than writing test cases for commercial applications, because if we knew what the output of the scientific code was supposed to be, we wouldn\u2019t be running the software: we\u2019d be writing up our results and moving on to the next program. In practice, scientists tend to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Test with simplified data_. Before doing statistics on a real data set, we should try calculating statistics for a single record, for two identical records, for two records whose values are one step apart, or for some other case where we can calculate the right answer by hand.\n",
    "2. _Test a simplified case_. If our program is supposed to simulate magnetic eddies in rapidly-rotating blobs of supercooled helium, our first test should be a blob of helium that isn\u2019t rotating, and isn\u2019t being subjected to any external electromagnetic fields. Similarly, if we\u2019re looking at the effects of climate change on speciation, our first test should hold temperature, precipitation, and other factors constant.\n",
    "3. _Compare to an oracle_. A [test oracle](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/reference.html#test-oracle) is something whose results are trusted, such as experimental data, an older program, or a human expert. We use test oracles to determine if our new program produces the correct results. If we have a test oracle, we should store its output for particular cases so that we can compare it with our new results as often as we like without re-running that program.\n",
    "4. _Check conservation laws_. Mass, energy, and other quantitites are conserved in physical systems, so they should be in programs as well. Similarly, if we are analyzing patient data, the number of records should either stay the same or decrease as we move from one analysis to the next (since we might throw away outliers or records with missing values). If \u201cnew\u201d patients start appearing out of nowhere as we move through our pipeline, it\u2019s probably a sign that something is wrong.\n",
    "5. _Visualize_. Data analysts frequently use simple visualizations to check both the science they\u2019re doing and the correctness of their code (just as we did in the opening lesson of this tutorial). This should only be used for debugging as a last resort, though, since it\u2019s very hard to compare two visualizations automatically."

    "Replacing random chunks of code is unlikely to do much good. (After all, if you got it wrong the first time, you\u2019ll probably get it wrong the second and third as well.) Good programmers therefore _change one thing at a time, for a reason_ They are either trying to gather more information (\u201cis the bug still there if we change the order of the loops?\u201d) or test a fix (\u201ccan we make the bug go away by sorting our data before processing it?\u201d).\n",

And we should re-run _all_ of our tests: more than half of fixes made to code introduce (or re-introduce) bugs, so re-running all of our tests tells us whether we have regressed."

    "And speaking of help: if we can\u2019t find a bug in 10 minutes, we should `be humble` and ask for help. Just explaining the problem aloud is often useful, since hearing what we\u2019re thinking helps us spot inconsistencies and hidden assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asking for help also helps alleviate confirmation bias. If we have just spent an hour writing a complicated program, we want it to work, so we\u2019re likely to keep telling ourselves why it should, rather than searching for the reason it doesn\u2019t. People who aren\u2019t emotionally invested in the code can be more objective, which is why they\u2019re often able to spot the simple mistakes we have overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of being humble is learning from our mistakes. Programmers tend to get the same things wrong over and over: either they don\u2019t understand the language and libraries they\u2019re working with, or their model of how things work is wrong. In either case, taking note of why the error occurred and checking for it next time quickly turns into not making the mistake at all.\n",

If we train ourselves to avoid making some kinds of mistakes, to break our code into modular, testable chunks, and to turn every assumption (or mistake) into an assertion, it will actually take us less time to produce working programs, not more."
