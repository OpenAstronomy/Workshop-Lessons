    "Once testing has uncovered problems, the next step is to fix them. Many novices do this by making more-or-less random changes to their code until it seems to produce the right answer, but that\u2019s very inefficient (and the result is usually only correct for the one case they\u2019re testing). The more experienced a programmer is, the more systematically they debug, and most follow some variation on the rules explained below."

    "The first step in debugging something is to _know what it\u2019s supposed to do_. \u201cMy program doesn\u2019t work\u201d isn\u2019t good enough: in order to diagnose and fix problems, we need to be able to tell correct output from incorrect. If we can write a test case for the failing case \u2014 i.e., if we can assert that with _these_ inputs, the function should produce _that_ result \u2014 then we\u2019re ready to start debugging. If we can\u2019t, then we need to figure out how we\u2019re going to know when we\u2019ve fixed things.\n",
    "\n",
    "But writing test cases for scientific software is frequently harder than writing test cases for commercial applications, because if we knew what the output of the scientific code was supposed to be, we wouldn\u2019t be running the software: we\u2019d be writing up our results and moving on to the next program. In practice, scientists tend to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. _Test with simplified data_. Before doing statistics on a real data set, we should try calculating statistics for a single record, for two identical records, for two records whose values are one step apart, or for some other case where we can calculate the right answer by hand.\n",
    "2. _Test a simplified case_. If our program is supposed to simulate magnetic eddies in rapidly-rotating blobs of supercooled helium, our first test should be a blob of helium that isn\u2019t rotating, and isn\u2019t being subjected to any external electromagnetic fields. Similarly, if we\u2019re looking at the effects of climate change on speciation, our first test should hold temperature, precipitation, and other factors constant.\n",
    "3. _Compare to an oracle_. A [test oracle](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/reference.html#test-oracle) is something whose results are trusted, such as experimental data, an older program, or a human expert. We use test oracles to determine if our new program produces the correct results. If we have a test oracle, we should store its output for particular cases so that we can compare it with our new results as often as we like without re-running that program.\n",
    "4. _Check conservation laws_. Mass, energy, and other quantitites are conserved in physical systems, so they should be in programs as well. Similarly, if we are analyzing patient data, the number of records should either stay the same or decrease as we move from one analysis to the next (since we might throw away outliers or records with missing values). If \u201cnew\u201d patients start appearing out of nowhere as we move through our pipeline, it\u2019s probably a sign that something is wrong.\n",
    "5. _Visualize_. Data analysts frequently use simple visualizations to check both the science they\u2019re doing and the correctness of their code (just as we did in the opening lesson of this tutorial). This should only be used for debugging as a last resort, though, since it\u2019s very hard to compare two visualizations automatically."

    "We can only debug something when it fails, so the second step is always to find a test case that _makes it fail every time_.

    "As part of this, it\u2019s always important to check that our code is \u201cplugged in\u201d, i.e., that we\u2019re actually exercising the problem that we think we are. Every programmer has spent hours chasing a bug, only to realize that they were actually calling their code on the wrong data set or with the wrong configuration parameters, or are using the wrong version of the software entirely. Mistakes like these are particularly likely to happen when we\u2019re tired, frustrated, and up against a deadline, which is one of the reasons late-night (or overnight) coding sessions are almost never worthwhile."

It\u2019s therefore critical to _make it fail fast_.\n",

Many programmers therefore use a divide and conquer strategy to find bugs, i.e., if the output of a function is wrong, they check whether things are OK in the middle, then concentrate on either the first or second half, and so on.\n",
    "2. N things can interact in $N^2$ different ways, so every line of code that isn\u2019t run as part of a test means more than one thing we don\u2019t need to worry about."

    "And speaking of help: if we can\u2019t find a bug in 10 minutes, we should `be humble` and ask for help. Just explaining the problem aloud is often useful, since hearing what we\u2019re thinking helps us spot inconsistencies and hidden assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asking for help also helps alleviate confirmation bias. If we have just spent an hour writing a complicated program, we want it to work, so we\u2019re likely to keep telling ourselves why it should, rather than searching for the reason it doesn\u2019t. People who aren\u2019t emotionally invested in the code can be more objective, which is why they\u2019re often able to spot the simple mistakes we have overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of being humble is learning from our mistakes. Programmers tend to get the same things wrong over and over: either they don\u2019t understand the language and libraries they\u2019re working with, or their model of how things work is wrong. In either case, taking note of why the error occurred and checking for it next time quickly turns into not making the mistake at all.\n",

If we train ourselves to avoid making some kinds of mistakes, to break our code into modular, testable chunks, and to turn every assumption (or mistake) into an assertion, it will actually take us less time to produce working programs, not more."
