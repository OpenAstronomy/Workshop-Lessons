The first time around, `length` is zero (the value assigned to it on line 1) and `vowel` is `'a'`. The statement adds 1 to the old value of `length`, producing 1, and updates `length` to refer to that new value. The next time around, `vowel` is `'e'` and `length` is 1, so length is updated to be 2.

If 2 parameters are input, range starts at the first and ends at the second, incrementing by one. If range is passed 3 parameters, it stars at the first one, ends at the second one, and increments by the third one. For example, `range(3)` produces the numbers 0, 1, 2, while `range(2, 5)` produces 2, 3, 4, and `range(3, 10, 3)` produces 3, 6, 9.
