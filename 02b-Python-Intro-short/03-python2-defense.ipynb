    "The first step toward getting the right answers from our programs is to assume that mistakes _will_ happen and to guard against them. This is called [defensive programming](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/reference.html#defensive-programming), and the most common way to do it is to add [assertions](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/reference.html#assertion) to our code so that it checks itself as it runs. An assertion is simply a statement that something must be true at a certain point in a program. When Python sees one, it evaluates the assertion\u2019s condition. If it\u2019s true, Python does nothing, but if it\u2019s false, Python halts the program immediately and prints the error message if one is provided. For example, this piece of code halts as soon as the loop encounters a value that isn\u2019t positive:"

Writing assertions to check that you haven\u2019t [regressed](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/reference.html#regression) (i.e., haven\u2019t re-introduced an old problem) can save a lot of time in the long run, and helps to warn people who are reading the code (including your future self) that this bit is tricky."
