This is partly due to discrepancies between how quickly the colour map changes and how quickly the data changes, and partly due to the fact that [different people see colour differently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dress_%28viral_phenomenon%29).<br/><br/>\n",

This leads to some parts of the colour map appearing to change very slowly, while other parts of the colour map shift from one hue to another in a very short space. The practical effect of this is to both smooth some parts of the image, obscuring the data, and to create artificial features in the image where the data is smooth.<br/><br/>\n",
