This leads to some parts of the colour map appearing to change very slowly, while other parts of the colour map shift from one hue to another in a very short space. The practical effect of this is to both smooth some parts of the image, obscuring the data, and to create artificial features in the image where the data is smooth.<br/><br/>\n",

    "A type of image file that you are quite likely to come across in astronomy is FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) files. This file type is used for storing various types of astronomical image data, including solar images. The advantage of FITS files is that as well as storing the numerical data which makes up the image, they also store a header associated with these data. The header usually contains information such as the spatial extent of the image, the resolution, the time at which the observation was taken, and various other properties of the data which may be useful when using the image for research. These pairs of data arrays and associated headers are stored in a HDU (Header-Data Unit). Several HDUs can be stored in a FITS file, so they are kept in a container called HDUList.\n",
